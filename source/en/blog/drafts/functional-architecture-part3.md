In the [previous post](http://www.devcrafting.com/en/blog/2017/06-functional-architecture-part2/), I starting a first F# implementation, showing "beauty" of F# code ;). Now it is time to improve a bit the controller function to be more fluent.

## Introduce the `bind` function and Monad



## Use Computation Expressions in F#



## Want to learn more?

I have just shown one use case of the bind function. I encourage you to have a look to the [very detailed series written by Scott Wlaschin](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/elevated-world/#series-toc), and in particular, there are more examples in this [one comparing applicative and monadic styles for validation](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/elevated-world-3/).
