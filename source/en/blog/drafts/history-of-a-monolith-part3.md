In the [previous parts of this series](), I focused on the genesis of the monolith we started at the end of 2005. I left the project in early 2007. It was then planned to grow quickly, then the team would have to adapt (in size and more...). I came back on the project in 2009, this post highlights new challenges we faced, evolution we made (lots of experiments) and consequences until 2012 when I left again.

## Back on board

In 2009, I came back in a team of 12 developers, whereas 2 years before, I left a team of 6 developers. It doubled in 2 years!

Technically, it was a continuation of the architecture set up in 2005.
