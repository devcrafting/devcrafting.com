# A bit of history (on my experiences on .NET and Java)

During first years of working (2004~2008), I focused on .NET platform (cause I was paid for...), but in my free time, I always kept a eye on Java ecosystem because it was my initial training. From the begining (of my "carrier"), I was interested in improving my skills. Around 2004, there was a lot more new things in the Java ecosystem than in the .NET one (or it was more confidential). In my opinion, the key was the community, lots of things emerged from the community in the Java ecosystem. .NET ecosystem was more focused on improving language: open source community was emerging, and Microsoft was still more focused on Visual Studio wizards than trying to really improve development practices...

During the first year, I was mostly trying to deliver "value" on (ugly) legacy system, learning and using .NET language, since I knew only Java when I started. I had a look at NUnit, I tried it, but I was not aware of TDD, neither of SOLID principles...it was too much things to master at this time.

Then, during the three following years, I started "from scratch" projects, tring to deliver value the "good way", based on knowledge I acquired previously...but I felt some "things" were still missing...obviously, I learned lots of new things also, following evolution and emergence of .NET community.

In 2008, I started to go to meetups (Alt.Net in Paris) and discovered that my feeling I was missing "things" was not an illusion :). Meetups helped me a lot to discover quickly (lots of) things I did not know. I was more confortable with language, frameworks and libs, and I started to focus more on practices and concepts (patterns, architecture styles...).

From this first 4 years experience, I feel I had to go through learning basic stuff about .NET platform, before I could try to dig practices and concepts. That is the base of "a sort of maturity model" I would like to talk about here. Let's dig my experiences after 2008 to exercise this model.

Note that following experiences were mostly after having started to pratice TDD and other pratices.

# My (small) experience with JS & Node.js

I used JS from the begining, but the hard way without any lib (I was targeting IE6!). Then I switched to jQuery. My JS development was like the poor man of my stack, I knew I was not doing "well" (or least "as good as" in .NET), I can't exactly explain why I did not try to improve in fact...a bad excuse ;): missing time?

Lately, I started using dependency management lib like Require.js, even more lately, I used a bit build tools like Gulp, Node.js with browserify, I started practicing TDD (with Jasmine and Mocha)...

Retrospectively, I think I did not consider JS as a core knowledge, so I spent not enough time to be improve my skills, I was missing some basic ones to be able to use practices like TDD. In fact, I did not even tried before I acquired better basic skills in JS. I think I would have struggled if I tried.

# My (small) experience with PHP

My PHP skills were very basic (back in high school, for an association website ;)). I was sold for a project as an architect who knew web development, e-commerce, MVC and "software good practices". With this, I was requested to be able to help rebuild an (ugly-old-style) PHP website...

I would be pleased to have your feedbacks on your experiences.
