My vision is that the goal of software engineering is to add value to business. I try to use technology to serve clients, users & projects. Technology must not be an end in itself. To achieve this, I rely on:

* [solutions that fit context in terms of architecture, design and technologies](./architecture-and-design/)
* [advanced and recognized software practices](./software-craftsmanship-practices/)
* [agile approach that fit context, based on practices from well-known methodologies](./agile-approaches/)
